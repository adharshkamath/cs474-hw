This folder contains the following:
- `formula1` : This file contains the set of clauses under consideration (in the syntax of the resolution tool). Note that this contains trivial and redundant clauses and the resolution tool will discard them from the input.
- `proof.json` : This file contains the resolution proof object generated by the resolution tool, after the resolution steps are entered manually into the tool
- `pt1.py` : This file contains the Z3 encoding of the original problem (with the initial set of clauses).
- `pt2.py` : This file contains the Z3 encoding of the eqivalence between the initial set of clauses and the final set of clauses after resolution.
- `resolved_formula1` : Contains the final set of clauses after resolution (in the syntax of the resolution tool).
