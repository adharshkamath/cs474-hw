This folder contains the following:
- `formula1` : This file contains the set of clauses under consideration (in the syntax of the resolution tool). Note that this contains trivial and redundant clauses and the resolution tool will discard them from the input.
- `proof.json` : This file contains the resolution proof object generated by the resolution tool, after the resolution steps are entered manually into the tool
